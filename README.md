# Weather Checker

Weather Checker is a Web Application that allows a user to search by [City Name], [City Name, State Name], or [Zip Code] to view the current weather in their searched city. This application uses the [https://openweathermap.org/api] current weather API.

## Getting Started

Please clone the github repository [https://github.com/Aseedholm/weather-checker.git]. Once cloned, please navigate to the weather-checker folder and run npm start from there to open the web application locally. 

### Prerequisites
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You will need to have Node.js installed, which will include npm which as a package manager. Using npm you will need to have react installed on your machine, additionally react-router-dom. Lastly you will need to install bootstrap via npm as well.  

```

React-Router-Dom
Bootstrap
```

### Installing

After the installation is complete use npm (included with the Node.js download) to install React. 
```

```

Once React has been installed please make sure to install react-router-dom for navigation in the web application. This dependency should already be included when the github repository is cloned as it was saved, if it is not, please install it. 
```
npm install react-router-dom
```

After react-router-dom is installed please make sure to install bootstrap as well via npm.
